## Introduction </a>

The character White Duck is back for another adventure but this time in a Python program. White Duck wants to have a little chat and play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The format is of an interactive story where the user will be able to add some input as the story develops accordingly. 

I created this character for my last portolio project on JavaScript and decided to develop it further for my Python project.

There's scope for developing this project further by adding more scenarios and options of differents paths and games. 
Also, I believe the code can be simplified further.

## Deployment </a>

Heroku

The deployment set up occured smoothly without any problems or errors although it did take some time for the app to become available at Heroku.

I regret not having deployed my app at the time I started working on my project but I still deployed it in time to adjust my code to the Heroku platform.
